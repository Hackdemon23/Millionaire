# ** MILLIONAIRE **

A multiplayer Who Wants To Be A Millionaire web game developed with **Vue.js**, **Express** and **MySQL** with three different player types as host, player and viewer. This game is selected as the **Best Mobile Application** by Vancouver Film School. It was developed with a team of three programmers and I worked mostly on backend functionality.

## ** My Role **
•	Implemented Nodejs Express server that interfaces with a MySQL database which can read/write game state data. 
•	Created game host player functionality with capability of session creation and game flow control.
•	Setup database with MySQL queries

## ** How To Use **
- Requires MySQL database and Node.js to be installed
- Use 'npm install' command to download the required packages
- Run 'Database.sql' queries to creat the database and 'TestData.sql' to fill it with sample data
- To display the app use 'npm run serve' once node packages are installed
- There are sample users added with test data called 'host' and 'viewer' who can be used for the game
